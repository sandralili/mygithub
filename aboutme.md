I enjoy walking outside. When the weather is nice, I go hiking. I also enjoy going to the beach.

<h1> My Hobbies </h1>

I like listening to music. I love The Beatles and music from the 60s (influenced by my parents!), but I like all kind of music. When I have time, I contribute translating or creating new pages in Spanish for Wikipedia.
