## BSc and MSc thesis supervision

I am supervising BSc and MSc projects in the broad areas of *information retrieval*, *natural language processing* and *data science*. Across BSc and MSc, I have supervised more than 45 projects. For all research directions, taking a look at papers at recent conferences (such as SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, EMNLP, ACL, KDD) and ongoing benchmark efforts (MSMarco, SQUAD 2.0, GLUE, decaNLP, TREC, Kaggle) may help you to figure out a topic of interest.

To give you a few concrete ideas, here are a number of thesis projects I supervised in recent years:

- [The Impact of Group Size on Collaborative Search](http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:d820f21f-66b0-44c0-9678-283134baca5b) (MSc)

## Courses
 
 Below are the resources I have developed for my courses (some are more up-to-date than others): 
 *Big Data Processing*, *Web and Database Technology* and *Information Retrieval*.

### Big Data Processing

Since 2013/2014 I have been teaching the second year Bachelor course *Big Data Processing* at TU Delft (with 2016/17 being the last time for now). The course covers a range of technologies in the Hadoop ecosystem after a short excursion into the streaming world; 
I created the material based on a number of great books, including [Mining of Massive Datasets](http://www.mmds.org/),
[Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce](https://lintool.github.io/MapReduceAlgorithms/), 
[Hadoop: The Definite Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920033448.do), [Programming Pig](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001811/index.html)
and [ZooKeeper](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028901.do).

### Web (and Database) Technology

Since 2013/2014 I have also been teaching the first year Bachelor course *Web and Database Technology* (known as TI1506 or CSE1500) at TU Delft, together with
[Alessandro Bozzon](http://alessandrobozzon.com/). I teach the Web technology part, which turned out to be quite a challenge due to
the wide variety of skill sets our incoming students possess (some work as Web developers, others have never written a single line of HTML
before the start of this course). 

The web lecture transcripts (with self-check questions, demo code, assignments, etc.) are available [here](https://chauff.github.io/cse1500-web-transcripts/).

Feel free to use the materials with acknowledgement.

Needless to say that this is ongoing work at all times - web tech changes quickly.

### Information Retrieval

In 2019/20 I co-taught the MSc Information Retrieval course with Nava Tintarev, splitting it along an IR and NLP line. The course setup, slides and group projects can be found [here](https://github.com/chauff/IN4325).
