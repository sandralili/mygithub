# Introduction: The Power of Visuals

According to marketing industry experts, the human brain can process images up to 60,000 times faster than words. They say that we don’t get a second chance to make a first impression.
This code-through explores the opportunity to demonstrate that visuals are better than words. We can imagine presenting information in long/boring reports with just numbers and numbers. However, we can easily present our data with simple graphics using the library Word Clouds 2. We will be using the tm library (text mining) to analyze and clean our data.

## Content Overview

The following analysis uses information of the COVID-19 data. The information contains data recorded daily, with variables as continent, location (country), new and total cases, new and total deaths, population, etc. 


## Learning Objectives

Specifically, with this code-through tutorial, we will learn how to visualizing and communicating statistical models with effect plots using R Markdown to blend exposition, R code and R output into nice reports and presentations creating easy-to-read graphics.


## Our Data

This table show some of the content of the dataset we are using. We are going to use the 2019 ASU salaries database. 
```{r}


URL <- 'https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1RoiO9bfpbXowprWdZrgtYXG9_WuK3NFemwlvDGdym7E/export?gid=1948400967&format=csv'
datos <- read.csv( URL )
head (datos[c(1,2,3,4)],10) %>% knitr::kable()

```
<br>
<br>

## Libray of Packages
We will be needing the following libraries:
```{r}
# library ( dplyr )  # helps organize our data
# library ( tm )  # data mining
# library ( wordcloud )  # creates the wordclouds
# library ( wordcloud2 )  # creates the wordclouds
# library ( RColorBrewer ) #  palette colors for cloud
```


# TM: Text Mining

## TM Package
The tm package, created by Ingo Feinerer, offers a powerful text data mining language for depurate complex text information to a nice clean ready-to-use data. ggplot2 is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties.


## Installing the Package 

For the tm library, you can type in the R console:
  install.packages("tm") or you can follow these steps:

![Install Button](C:\Users\sandr\OneDrive\Pictures\tm\tm1.png)
![Type Name](C:\Users\sandr\OneDrive\Pictures\tm\tm2.png)
![Click install](C:\Users\sandr\OneDrive\Pictures\tm\tm3.png)
<br>
<br>


## Corpus Transformations
TM contains the following functions:
```{r}

getTransformations()

```

<br>
<br>



## Preparing data with the TM function 

Send the information of the "Full Name" column to the vector "words" to start the data cleaning
```{r}

words <- getwd()
words <- VCorpus(VectorSource(datos$Department.Description))
words [[1]][[1]]
words [[2]][[1]]
dataframe <- data.frame(text=unlist(sapply(words, `[`, "content")), 
    stringsAsFactors=F)

```


<br>
<br>



This function removes any punctuation that we do not need for our data transformation
```{r}

words1 <- tm_map(words, removePunctuation)
words1 [[1]][[1]] 
words1 [[2]][[1]] 

```
<br>
<br>

This function removes numbers from our data
```{r}

words2 <- tm_map(words1, removeNumbers)
words2 [[1]][[1]]
words2 [[2]][[1]]

```
<br>
<br>

This function change our data to lower caps
```{r}

words3 <- tm_map(words2, content_transformer(tolower))
words3 [[1]][[1]]
words3 [[2]][[1]]

```
<br>
<br>

This function returns various kinds of stopwords with support for different languages, in this case "English"
```{r}

words4 <- tm_map(words3, removeWords, stopwords ("english"))
words4 [[1]][[1]]
words4 [[2]][[1]]

```
<br>
<br>

This function removes white spaces from our data
```{r}

words6 <- tm_map(words4, stripWhitespace)
words6 [[1]][[1]]
words6 [[2]][[1]]
```
<br>
<br>


This function changes our data structure. Text mining packages work with a document-term matrix (or DTM)
```{r}

dtm <- DocumentTermMatrix(words6)
dtm [[1]][[1]]

```
<br>
<br>

Now, our data is ready for our word cloud graphic.
<br>
<br>


# Word Cloud


## Wordcloud Package
The wordcloud package, created by Ian Fellows, creates pretty word clouds, visualize differences and similarity between documents, and avoid over-plotting in scatter plots with text.


## Installing the Package 
For the tm library, you can type in the R console:
  install.packages("wordcloud") or you can follow these steps:
  
![Install Button](C:\Users\sandr\OneDrive\Pictures\wc\wc1.png)
![Type Name](C:\Users\sandr\OneDrive\Pictures\wc\wc2.png)
![Click install](C:\Users\sandr\OneDrive\Pictures\wc\wc3.png)

## Arguments

words - the words

freq - their frequencies

scale - A vector of length 2 indicating the range of the size of the words.

min.freq - words with frequency below min.freq will not be plotted

max.words - Maximum number of words to be plotted. least frequent terms dropped

random.order - plot words in random order. If false, they will be plotted in decreasing frequency

random.color - choose colors randomly from the colors. If false, the color is chosen based on the frequency

rot.per - proportion words with 90 degree rotation

colors - color words from least to most frequent

ordered.colors - if true, then colors are assigned to words in order

use.r.layout - if false, then c++ code is used for collision detection, otherwise R is used

fixed.asp - if TRUE, the aspect ratio is fixed. Variable aspect ratio only supported if rot.per==0

... - Additional parameters to be passed to text (and strheight,strwidth).


## Colors

The brewer function will help us to choose a palette to be used in out wordcloud
```{r}

color1 = brewer.pal(5, "BrBG")
color2 = brewer.pal(5, "Set2")
color3 = brewer.pal(5, "Paired")
display.brewer.all((colorblindFriendly=TRUE))

```


## Word Cloud Creation, 

Figure 1 - All words horizontal
```{r}

wordcloud(words6, 
          scale=c(5.0, 1), 
          random.order = FALSE, 
          max.words = 75,
          rot.per = 0,
          colors = color1)
title(main= "Department Description Popular Words",
      cex.main=2)

```

Figure 2 - Horizontal and Vertical words
```{r}

wordcloud(words6, 
          scale=c(5.0,1), 
          random.order = FALSE, 
          max.words = 100,
          rot.per = 0.50,
          colors = color2)
title(main= "Department Description Popular Words",
      cex.main=2)

```


Figure 3 - All Words Vertical
```{r}

wordcloud(words6, 
          scale=c(5.0, 1), 
          random.order = FALSE, 
          max.words = 150,
          rot.per = 100,
          colors = color3)
title(main= "Department Description Popular Words",
      cex.main=2)

```
