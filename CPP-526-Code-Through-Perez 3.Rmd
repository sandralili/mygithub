# Content Overview

The following analysis uses information of the COVID-19 data. The information contains data recorded daily, with variables as continent, location (country), new and total cases, new and total deaths, population, etc.

## Learning Objectives

Specifically, with this code-through tutorial, we will learn how to visualizing and communicating statistical models with effect plots using R Markdown to blend exposition, R code and R output into nice reports and presentations creating easy-to-read graphics.

## Installing the Package

The easiest way to get ggplot2 is to install the whole tidyverse:
  install.packages("tidyverse")

Alternatively, install just ggplot2:
  install.packages("ggplot2")

Or the development version from GitHub:
  install.packages("devtools")
  
  devtools::install_github("tidyverse/ggplot2")

 Sometimes, it is easier to follow visual instrucions, therefore there is a great YouTube video that will guide us to install this package, step by step:
* [ggplot2 Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr2X7rmkprM)

## ggplot2
The ggplot2 package, created by Hadley Wickham, offers a powerful graphics language for creating elegant and complex plots. ggplot2 is a plotting package that makes it simple to create complex plots from data in a data frame. It provides a more programmatic interface for specifying what variables to plot, how they are displayed, and general visual properties.

This package contains many functions to create differnt types of graphics. These ones are very popular:
-- geom_bar() - to create bar plots

-- geom_line() - to create line plots 

-- geom_density() - to create a density chart

-- geom_point() - the point geom is used to create scatterplots


Rstudio created Cheat Sheet with information about Data Visualization with ggplot2. We can visit this page:
* [ggplot2-cheatsheet](https://rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)

# Our Data

This table show some of the content of the dataset we are using. We will be using the columns Continent, date, new_cases, and new_deaths mainly.

```{r}

head (new.table.2)

```

<br>
<br>

## Example 1: Table vs Bars Graphic

We group our information by continent to find out how many cases per continent. We use the commands group_by and summarize.

```{r}

# New cases and new deaths per continent
new.table.2 %>%
  
 group_by (continent) %>%
  
 summarize (new.cases = round(sum(new_cases, na.rm = TRUE)), 
             new.deaths = round(sum(new_deaths, na.rm = TRUE)))

```

<br>
<br>

Now the same information but using a visual, no doubt that it is easier to understand! We will be using the ggplot() and geom_bar() functions. Fill will be determined by the continent variable.

```{r}

# New cases per continent bars graphic

new.table.2 %>%

 group_by (continent) %>%
  
 summarize(total.cases = sum(new_cases, na.rm = TRUE), 
            total.deaths = sum(new_deaths, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = 'drop')
  
 ggplot (new.table.2, 
         aes(x = continent, 
         fill = continent)) + 
         geom_bar()
  
```

<br>
<br>

## Example 2: Table vs Plot

We group our information by date and continent to find out how many each continenthad every day. We use the commands group_by and summarize again.

```{r}

# New cases per date and continent lines graphic 

new.table.2 %>%
  
  group_by (date, continent) %>%
  
  summarize (cases.per.date  = mean (new_cases), .groups = 'drop') 

```

<br>
<br>

Again the same information from the table but using a visual. We will be using the ggplot() again,  the geom_line(), and the geom_point() functions. The color of the lines and points will be determined by the continent variable.

```{r}

# New cases per date and continent lines graphic 

new.table.2 %>%
  
  group_by (date, continent) %>%
  
  summarize (cases.per.date  = mean (new_cases), .groups = 'drop') %>%

  ggplot (aes(x = date, 
              y = cases.per.date, 
              color = continent)) +
  
  geom_line (size=1) + 
   
  geom_point (size=1.5)
     
```

<br>
<br>

## A Dynamic Graphic
The ggplot() allows us to make a dynamic visualization. We just need to use the transition_reveal() function with the date variable. Using the ggplot() will make an elegant graphic!

```{r}

# New cases per date and continent lines dynamic graphic

new.table.2 %>%
  
  group_by (date, continent) %>%
  
  summarize (cases.per.date  = mean (new_cases), .groups = 'drop') %>%

  ggplot (aes(x = date, 
              y = cases.per.date, 
              color = continent)) +
  
  geom_line (size=1) + 
  
  transition_reveal(date)
   
#  geom_point (size=1.5)
     
```

<br>
<br>

## Example 3: Another Cool Graphic
Another way to present information using the ggplot() is by using the function geom_density(). We want to find the average of the population older than 65 years per continent. We group the information and display it using a table. Then we create the graphic and we can notice that the visualization is very simple and easier to understand!

```{r}

# density graphic 


new.table.2 %>%
  
  group_by (continent, aged_65_older) %>%
  
  summarize (average.aged.65.older  = mean (aged_65_older), .groups = 'drop') 

  
```



```{r}

# density graphic 


new.table.2 %>%
  
  group_by (continent, aged_65_older) %>%
  
  summarize (average.aged.65.older  = mean (aged_65_older), .groups = 'drop') %>%

  ggplot (aes(x = average.aged.65.older, 
           fill = continent)) +
    
  geom_density(alpha=0.2)


```
